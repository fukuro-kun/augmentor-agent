# Documentation index

Licensing and publication: [combined Augmentor license](LICENSING.md),
[public source and privacy review](PUBLIC-SOURCE.md),
[canonical repository, archives and preserved work](REPOSITORIES.md).

GitHub is the maintained source of truth. A new agent should begin with
[Start here: agent handoff](AGENT-HANDOFF.md), which identifies the development
branch, qualified commit, repositories and unfinished work. Current guides explain
behavior; dated plans/evidence explain decisions and what passed at that time.
A passed historical build is not qualification of a later source checkout.

Each area below has an owning guide. For a change, update that guide, the feature
matrix and relevant setup/data/test instructions together. Source and installed
state must remain distinct. Private logs, credentials and conversations stay out
of this repository; include reproducible commands and sanitized evidence summaries.

Concurrent uncommitted features are not a GitHub handoff. Add their guides here
when their implementation and validation are published, rather than linking
files available only in a developer's working directory.

- [Controlled memory and selected context](CONTROLLED-MEMORY.md): current bounded inference, provenance, tests and operating limits.

- [Home desktop tray launcher](HOME-LAUNCHER.md): shared NAS dashboard access, remembered address and login startup.
