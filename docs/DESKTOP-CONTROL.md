# Linux desktop control preview

Pi and DSH use the same per-user desktop executor. It captures a consented screen
and can click, send a short key chord or type up to 256 ASCII characters into an
accessible focused control. The browser role has no desktop input tools.

The current target is Debian 13, KDE Plasma Wayland, one active monitor and a
model configured for image input. The desktop package supplies the capture/input
dependencies. The Augmentor window and independent Stop control use XWayland;
the tested target application, Kate, uses native Wayland. Other desktops,
multiple monitors, password fields and non-ASCII typing are not supported.

## Using it

1. Open the intended application and a harmless test document. Enable
   accessibility for that application. Configure an image-capable model in Pi,
   or declare image input in the DSH provider configuration.
2. Ask Augmentor for a bounded action. The OS opens **Remote control requested**.
   Choose **Share** yourself to allow capture and keyboard/pointer input. If the
   dialog opens behind another window, select it with Alt+Tab. Declining or
   cancelling it leaves sharing closed.
3. Keep the independent **Stop desktop control** button visible. Either that
   button or chat **Stop** closes sharing and releases held keys. A turn ending
   also releases its owned connection; five idle minutes close unused sharing.
4. Inspect the application or saved file to verify the result. Input dispatch
   alone does not prove success. After cancellation, text may be partial; an
   uncertain action must not be replayed automatically.

Each action requires a screenshot with a fresh compositor-owned window identity.
Its target token expires after 30 seconds and is consumed once, including refused
actions. The executor rejects a changed or covered target, changed monitor
geometry, inaccessible keyboard focus and another chat's ownership. These checks
reduce accidental input; they are not an operating-system sandbox.

Screenshots go to the selected model and may remain in the harness conversation
history. The executor itself writes no screenshot file and does not use the
clipboard to type. See DATA-AND-SUPPORT.md for data locations and deletion limits.

The Pi development runtime now also offers a [bounded desktop
specialist](DESKTOP-SPECIALIST.md). Its screenshots stay in a separate worker
context and private local evidence files; the coordinator receives a short
structured result. This has different retention behavior from direct desktop
tools. The native executor and its platform limitations remain the same.

## X11 backend (x11-xtest)

On non-Wayland Linux sessions the executor selects `services/desktop/x11.py`
(backend id `x11-xtest`) instead of the KDE portal path. It was tested on
Ubuntu/MATE X11 and keeps the same safety contract: explicit consent before
capture or input, an independent visible Stop control, per-conversation
ownership, consumed-once target tokens and no replay of unknown-outcome
actions.

Differences from the Wayland backend:

- Consent is an in-process Qt dialog; X11 has no portal-mediated consent.
- Capture uses Flameshot when available (`flameshot full -r`) and falls back
  to `QScreen.grabWindow`. Input uses XTEST via python-xlib.
- Multi-monitor sessions are allowed. The backend follows the active EWMH
  window and captures the monitor containing it; a window that cannot be
  resolved blocks the action.
- Typing still targets an AT-SPI accessible focused control and ASCII text.

The same-tool checks (changed/covered target, changed geometry, focus and
ownership) apply unchanged.

## Reproducible evidence

`scripts/vm-desktop-proof.py` drives a disposable full Plasma Wayland VM. It
checks declined consent, Stop during consent, target/owner/replay refusals, actual
Kate Save As contents, and interruption of a long write through the independent
Stop button. `--scale` selects 1, 1.25 or 1.5. By default it runs the installed
executor; `--source` explicitly records candidate source staging instead.

`scripts/vm-desktop-engines-proof.py` uses actual Pi and DSH SDK tools with a
deterministic HTTP model. A private SSH socket forwards only desktop operations
to that VM, while host desktop autostart is disabled. It verifies actual image
bytes reaching the model, exact saved-file text and cancellation. The model
fixture supplies known coordinates; this is not a visual-reasoning benchmark.

The exact tested candidate and scales are recorded in PRODUCTIZATION-STATUS.md.
Independent hardware/users and model quality remain beta gates. The VM uses a
consistent Nehalem CPU model: `release/vm-avx-mask-proof.c` reproduces a masked
AVX2 load fault in QEMU 10.0.11 TCG that also crashed Qt/Breeze. The test avoids
that emulator defect without changing Qt or the user's system.
