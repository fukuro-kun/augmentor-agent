# Current architecture

Current development source: Augmentor 0.2.9 preview. Start with the
[agent handoff](AGENT-HANDOFF.md) for the authoritative Git ref and evidence.
The [documentation index](README.md) maps every subsystem to its detailed guide.
The [original 0.1 design](HISTORICAL-ARCHITECTURE-0.1.md) is historical.

Installed Linux desktop selection follows [desktop deployments](DESKTOP-DEPLOYMENTS.md):
one atomic descriptor selects a separately staged release for login, launchers,
recovery and mobile. Working source trees are not the installed release.

## Product and runtime ownership

Augmentor is one product with native PySide6/Qt and Chromium surfaces in this
repository. Both DSH presentations use [one personal-agent composition and voice engine](SHARED-SURFACES-2026-09-24.md); preset IDs are historical aliases. DSH is the full-featured conversational harness; Pi is a supported
subset. Each chat stays owned by its selected harness. Neither memory nor voice
starts another conversational agent. OpenCode is retired; its old data remains.

```

The diagram shows logical ownership, not every transport call. Voice uses the
existing authenticated DSH session and generation protocol. Desktop authority
is not granted to a browser session by sharing a host or memory bank.

The [Home development preview](HOME.md) adds a headless host of the same DSH
session/tool lifecycle. Home Assistant owns device integrations through official
Assist MCP; Home grants neither desktop tools nor personal memory. Its application
code is in this repository and its deployment companion holds private home state.

## Memory decision

The user requested two independent kinds of continuity: relationship knowledge
and project state. Reuse MIT-licensed Hindsight 0.10.0 for extraction,
consolidation, knowledge pages and hybrid retrieval. Relationship banks maintain
wiki-like pages; project banks support semantic retrieval plus a current-state
page. This is one maintained memory engine with separate banks, not one mixed
summary. A vector database alone would not maintain a distilled relationship;
handwritten summaries would duplicate existing memory-engine work.

Augmentor owns capture, stable person/project bindings, a durable SQLite source
journal, durable processing stages/budgets, selected cached context, and separate
capture/processing pause controls. Its memory-only gateway admits inference only
during bounded activity windows; no idle archive drain is permitted. See
[controlled memory](CONTROLLED-MEMORY.md).
Hindsight owns PostgreSQL/pgvector, derived facts, observations and pages. The
custom automatic summarizer is retired. Voice signals a relational register;
it does not establish speaker identity. Both typed and spoken turns can
contribute to both banks. See [dual memory](DUAL-MEMORY.md) for boundaries.

## State and recovery contracts

Pi persists its own conversation state; DSH persists its own. Shared memory does
not merge or convert conversations. Prompt records are independently stored in
`prompts.sqlite3`; automatic transcript memory uses `dual-memory.sqlite3`.
Speech configuration belongs to the Augmentor Voice plugin config and the
local `voice_*` preferences. UI preferences belong to the surface. [Data and support](DATA-AND-SUPPORT.md) explains data flow and retention.

Preserve selected models, explicit surface authority, Stop, pending interactions,
and original history. A reconnect or unknown acknowledgment must not replay a
model/tool action. Historical branching must preserve the selected boundary and
must not inject newer automatic memory into the historical context. Memories,
web pages and transcripts are evidence, never execution authority.

## Deployment boundaries

Source, CI artifacts, installed packages and the user-local preview are distinct.
The September memory upgrade stages a versioned user-local adapter and requires
idle DSH/voice before activation; it does not replace the root-owned desktop or
installed browser extension. Native controls refresh on a natural restart.
Speech is a separate versioned tarball, not a sibling runtime import.
See [handoff](AGENT-HANDOFF.md) for exact qualification and remaining work.


The September 20 user-local desktop deployment has one registered build and a
graphical-session supervisor. DSH startup ownership is shared by its surfaces;
permanent saved-chat failures are distinguished from transport loss. See
[restart reliability](RESTART-RELIABILITY-2026-09-20.md) for installation scope,
legacy diagnostic repair and cold-start evidence.
