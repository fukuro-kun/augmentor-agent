# Augmentor Agent Browser

The maintained Chromium MV3 surface supports DSH and Pi through a shared native
messaging entrypoint. It shares prompt records and memory services with the
native desktop. Both DSH surfaces now use one personal agent with the same tools,
approvals, saved conversations and speech engine.
[Feature matrix](../../docs/FEATURE-MATRIX.md) records actual harness support;
[distribution](../../docs/BROWSER-DISTRIBUTION.md) is the current install guide.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `extension/` | Side panel, settings, service worker, page executor, overlays and thin voice controls |
| `native-host.mjs` | Product handshake, harness selection and shared-service access |
| `pi-bridge.mjs` | Pi host bridge and browser lifecycle |
| `pipe.mjs`, `plugin/`, `wire.mjs` | DSH browser transport/plugin and wire primitives |
| `test/` | Current DOM and bridge regressions; imported old suites may require their original fixtures |

Browser audio controls are served by the in-repo
[Augmentor Voice LAN plugin](../../docs/VOICE-LAN.md) (`adapters/dsh-voice-lan`,
protocol `augmentor-voice/1` over the LAN InferenzQuelle); the private
Resonant Voice artifact was never shipped in this fork.
Browser capture/playback and hands-free directly reuse the native engine through
a private host worker. See [shared surfaces](../../docs/SHARED-SURFACES-2026-09-24.md). Installing
a speech tarball or activating the shared memory adapter does not update an
already loaded extension; build/install/reload the matching reviewed artifact.

Read [browser settings](../../docs/BROWSER-SETTINGS.md),
[recovery](../../docs/BROWSER-RECOVERY-REVIEW.md),
[automatic memory](../../docs/DUAL-MEMORY.md) and
[voice controls](../../docs/VOICE-SINGLE-BUTTON.md).
Tests and installed acceptance are mapped in [tests](../../tests/README.md).

The imported [DSH-only README](HISTORICAL-DSH-README.md),
[proposal](PROPOSAL-plugin-architecture.md), [release plan](RELEASE-PLAN.md) and
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) preserve browser history. They do not override current
root product versions, setup instructions or qualification.
